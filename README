#1: DOS attack sending conf BPDUs

    Let's send some conf BPDUs claiming be root!!! By sending continously conf BPDU with root pathcost 0, randomly
    generated bridge id (and therefore the same root id), and some default values for other fields, we try to 
    annoy the switches close to us, causing a DoS when trying to parse and recalculate their STP engines.

    Source MAC: randomly generated.
    Destination MAC: 01:80:c2:00:00:00
    Bridge ID: 8000:source_mac
    Root ID: 8000:source_mac
    Hello time: 2
    Forward delay: 15
    Max age: 20
    Root pathcost: 0

#2: DOS attack sending tcn BPDUs

    This attack sends continously tcn BPDUs causing the root switch to send conf BPDUs acknowledging the change. 
    Besides, the root switch will send topology change notifications to the members of the tree, and they will
    have to recalculate their STP engine to learn the new change.

    Source MAC: randomly generated.
    Destination MAC: 01:80:c2:00:00:00

    </output>


#3: NONDOS attack Claiming Root Role

    Now our aim is to get the root role of the tree. How can we accomplish this issue? Just listening to the network
    to find out which one is the root role, and start sending conf BPDU with lower priority to become root.

    Source MAC: same one as the sniffed BPDU.
    Destination MAC: same one as the sniffed BPDU.
    Bridge ID: the sniffed one slightly modified to have a lower priority
    Root ID: 8000: same as bridge id.
    Hello time: same one as the sniffed BPDU.
    Forward delay: same one as the sniffed BPDU.
    Max age: same one as the sniffed BPDU.
    Root pathcost: same one as the sniffed BPDU.

    </output>


#4 NONDOS attack Claiming a non-root role

   We pretend to be another weird switch playing with STP and praising our root id :)


#5 DOS attack causing eternal root elections

    By sending config BPDUs autodecrementing their priority, we can cause infinite root elections in the STP tree.
    It would be something similar to recount the election's votes to determine the winner (do you remember Florida?)

#6 DOS Attack causing root dissapearance

    This time we try to exhaust the root election proccess. We manage to become root in the STP tree,
    but we stop sending config BPDUs until it reaches max_age seconds (usually 20), forcing a new 
    election proccess.

Mitigations (Cisco only)
------------------------

- Use port security and disable STP in those ports that don't require STP.
For information about port security, please check the following url:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps628/products_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080150bcd.html

- If you are using the portfast feature in your STP configuration, enable also the BPDU guard for avoiding these
attacks when the port automatically enters the forwarding state:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/473/65.html

- Use the root guard feature for avoiding rogue devices to become root:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk389/tk621/technologies_tech_note09186a00800ae96b.shtml

CDP 
---

Cisco devices have always spoken a different language to communicate among them,
to tell everybody that they are alive and which nifty features they have. CDP
stands for Cisco Discovery Protocol. By means of this particular language, Cisco
devices set up a virtual world where everyone is happy and ther is no crime at
all. Or at least it seems to be this way, since many network administrators
aren't worried for CDP yet. Although some of information that can be sent in a
CDP packet is still undocumented (CDP is a propietary protocol and it seems that
Cisco does not want to give details about it), at least one old attack (that it
is still valid) is known, and there is a public implementation (FX did it!).

This attack is a DoS trying to exhaust the device memory so that it can't
allocate more memory for any device process. How can we do it? Simply sending
CDP packets with bogus data simulating real Cisco devices. The target device
will begin to allocate memory in its CDP table to save the new neighbor
information, but without knowing that it is going to have thousands or millions
of new friends.

Other attack implemented in the current code is the ability to set up a new
virtual Cisco device that it is designated only for make a little mess, trying
to confuse network administrators.

Screenshot of the attack running:

And then, the CDP process is totally down, even when we stop the attack. No more CDP babies...
